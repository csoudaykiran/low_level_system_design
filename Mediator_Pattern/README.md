| Aspect                        | **Mediator Pattern (Teacher as Router)**             | **Observer Pattern (Teacher as Announcer)**             |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who starts communication?** | Students send messages to the Teacher                | Teacher sends announcements to Students                 |
| **Who talks to whom?**        | Student → Teacher → Other Students                   | Teacher → Students                                      |
| **Flow direction**            | Many-to-many (via mediator)                          | One-to-many                                             |
| **Control logic lives in**    | Teacher (Mediator decides routing)                   | Teacher (only broadcasts; no routing logic)             |
| **Example use case**          | Chat room, air traffic control, classroom discussion | Notification system, event listener, broadcast messages |
| **Goal**                      | Simplify and centralize message coordination         | Notify all subscribers automatically                    |
| **Coupling**                  | Students are decoupled from each other               | Students are decoupled from the Teacher’s inner logic   |


So in short:

Mediator = controlled conversation 💬
Observer = automatic announcement 📢

problem in code :

🧩 1️⃣ Stage 1 – Simple classroom ✅

Everyone just sends and receives messages.

One global list works fine.

✅ Works well — no problem yet.

🧩 2️⃣ Stage 2 – Different message types 📬

Now teacher says:

“Some messages are announcements, some are private messages.”

Now A wants to send a private message to B only.

Suddenly:

send_message() must know who to send to (maybe use receiver name or id).

So Student needs logic to find that person.

❌ Now Student class starts doing too many things:

It holds data (name),

Sends messages,

Knows how to route messages,

Knows all other students (to find the receiver).

This breaks Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

🧩 3️⃣ Stage 3 – Rules get complex 🎓

Teacher adds more rules:

Don’t send private messages to yourself.

Some students are muted.

Some messages go to a subgroup (like “Team Blue”).

Some messages go only to the teacher.

Now your simple loop for s in students: becomes:

for s in students:
    if s != self and not s.is_muted and s.group == "Blue":
        s.receive_message(message, self.name)


😵 It’s getting messy!

Each student now needs to know:

who’s muted,

who’s in which group,

which message type is allowed.

💣 Result: Tight coupling explosion

Every Student is directly dealing with:

The list of all others,

The rules of who to send to,

The communication logic.

So if you change any rule, you must modify all students.
That’s the same as a classroom where everyone has to memorize every rule themselves instead of the teacher managing it.

💡 Solution: Bring in the Mediator 🎯

Let’s introduce a ClassroomMediator (the Teacher).

Now:

Each student only knows the teacher.

The teacher knows everyone.

The teacher decides who gets messages and how.
