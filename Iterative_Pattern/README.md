Main Objective of the Iterator Pattern

üëâ The Iterator Pattern‚Äôs main goal is to provide a uniform way to traverse (retrieve) elements of a collection without exposing its internal representation.


The Iterator Pattern is about retrieving/traversing, not storing.



Imagine you have multiple types of collections:

List ‚Üí Sequential

Dict ‚Üí Key-value

Set ‚Üí Unordered unique items

Tree ‚Üí Hierarchical structure

Without the iterator pattern:
Each collection needs custom traversal logic.
Clients need to know how data is stored


With the iterator pattern:

Client can simply say:

for item in collection:
    print(item)


No knowledge of internal storage or logic required.

| --- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | **Client depends on internal storage**   | The client must know whether books are stored in a list or dict to iterate correctly.                      |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | **Violates OCP (Open/Closed Principle)** | If we add a new storage type (e.g., `set` or `tuple`), we must modify both `add_book()` and client code.   |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | **Tight Coupling**                       | The client is tightly coupled to the collection‚Äôs internal representation (`list` or `dict`).              |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **Code duplication**                     | Both `list` and `dict` handling are done manually with `if/elif`. If we add more types, duplication grows. |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | **Difficult to extend**                  | Adding a new type like `JSONStorage` means rewriting `add_book()` and changing client logic.               |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | **Encapsulation leakage**                | Returning a copy of `__books` still exposes internal data structure type.                                  |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£ | **Client iteration inconsistency**       | For list: `for book in books`; for dict: `for key, val in books.items()`. No uniform interface.            |


You have a BookCollection class that stores books.
Currently, the client decides how the books are stored (list, dict, etc.), and also loops differently based on structure.

This:

couples client and internal data representation,

violates the Open‚ÄìClosed Principle, and

breaks encapsulation (client knows how data is stored).

We‚Äôll fix it using the Iterator Pattern.


solution :
Hide Internal Storage and Introduce Iteration Interface

We will:

remove storage_type from client,

internally decide how books are stored (could be list, dict, or anything),

and give client a uniform way to iterate ‚Üí for book in collection:

That‚Äôs where the Iterator Pattern helps.
